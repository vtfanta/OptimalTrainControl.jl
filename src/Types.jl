"""
An Enum useful for specifying the five possible control modes:
- `MaxP`: Maximum power; usually takes place at the start.
- `HoldP`: Cruising; holding constant speed with positive input.
- `HoldR`: Regenerative braking; holding constant speed with negative input, can only take place on steep downhill segments.
- `Coast`: Coasting; neither applying power or braking.
- `MaxB`: Maximum braking; usually takes place at the end.

    train = Train(U̅, U̲, r, ρ = 0)

Defines a `train` to be used in `TOTCProblem` or `EETCProblem` construction

# Arguments
- `U̅::Function`: maximum traction specific force (per unit mass, i.e. acceleration) as a function of speed.
- `U̲::Function`: minimum traction specific force (braking, per unit mass, i.e. acceleration) as a function of speed.
- `r::Tuple`: triplet of coefficients defining resistance of the `train` as a quadratic function of the speed `resistance(v) = r[1] + r[2]v + r[3]v^2 `.
- `ρ::Real = 0`: regeneration coefficient ``ρ ∈ [0,1]`` specifying proportion of braking speed recovered (0 means no regeneration, 1 means all braking energy regenerated).

# Example
```julia
train = Train(
    U̅ = v ->  1/v,
    U̲ = v -> -1/v,
    r = (1e-2, 0., 1.5e-5),
    ρ = 0.3

    track = Track(;length <keyword arguments>)

Defines a `track` to be used in `TOTCProblem` or `EETCProblem` construction



# Arguments
- `altitude::Real`: altitude of the start of the `track`.
- `x_gradient::Vector{Real}`: vector of positions at which the gradient changes.
- `gradient::Vector{Real}`: vector of grade values in rise/run, positive means uphill.
- `x_speedlimit::Vector{Real}`: vector of positions at which the speed limit changes.

```julia
# Flat track
flat_track = Track(length = 1e3)

# Hilly track

    sol1::OTCSolution = solve(p1::TOTCProblem)
    sol2::OTCSolution = solve(p2::EETCProblem)

Is returned as a result of solving a `TOTCProblem` or a `EETCProblem`.

# Fields
- `odesol::SciMLBase.ODESolution`: solution of the differential equation coming from DifferentialEquations.jl package. The states are `[time, speed]` and are accessed with e.g. `sol1.u`. The distances along the track are accessed via e.g. `sol1.t`. The interpolation functionality should behave as expected although this is not guaranteed since the problem has multiple phases.
- `x_phases::Vector{Real}`: sequence of positions at which control modes (see [`Mode`](@ref)) changes.
- `phases::Vector{Mode}`: sequence of control modes (see [`Mode`](@ref)).
- `control::Function`: optimal control as a function of distance along the track.
- `η::Vector{Real}`: trajectory of the adjoint variable determining the current control mode (see [`Mode`](@ref)).
